### Bike Demand Prediction Accuracy on varying Humidity and Windspeed

Humidity and Windspeed based on our analysis are *non-dominant* feature variables. Let's analyse how our model predicts the demand of bikes when all other variables are fixed but humidity and windspeed are changed.

The sample input shows that all variables are fixed except Humidity and Windspeed: 

```{r sample_Set_Hour}
loadPkg("kableExtra")
Demo_df[1:2,c(1:10)] %>% kableExtra::kable() %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

The prediction of different models are shown below:

```{r Non_des}
Demo_df[1:2,c(11:16)] %>% kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Actual Bike Demand","Full Linear Model","Reduced Linear Model","Decision Tree","Grid Search Random Forest","Random Forest")) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

The 3 variable Random Forest i.e. the last column has the closest predictions, second closest model in this scenario is Random Forest (Using Grid Search).

### Bike Demand Prediction Accuracy on varying Hour Of the Day

We know that *Hour of the day* variable is a dominant feature with Hour of day - 18 being the most important level. We want to see how our created models predict when Hour of the day is varied and other variables are kept constant.

Sample Input Set : 

```{r varying_hour}
Demo_df[3:8,c(1:10)] %>% kableExtra::kable(row.names = FALSE) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

The prediction of different models are shown below:

```{r predict_val}
Demo_df[3:8,c(11:16)] %>% kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Actual Bike Demand","Full Linear Model","Reduced Linear Model","Decision Tree","Grid Search Random Forest","Random Forest"),row.names = FALSE) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

From the results, we notice that 3-variable random forest (i.e. last column) performs the best.

### Bike Demand Prediction Accuracy for Weekdays and Weekends

We want to verify how well our created models predict the demand for bikes on weekdays and weekends.

Sample Input Set:

```{r weekday}
Demo_df[9:10,c(1:10)] %>% kableExtra::kable(row.names = FALSE) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

The prediction of different models are shown below:

```{r weekpredict}
Demo_df[9:10,c(11:16)] %>% kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Actual Bike Demand","Full Linear Model","Reduced Linear Model","Decision Tree","Grid Search Random Forest","Random Forest"),row.names = FALSE) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

We observe that error rate is least in the last column, which is for random forest.

### Bike Demand Prediction Accuracy for Holidays and Working Days

We want to validate how well our generated models predict the demand for bikes on Holidays and Working Days.

Sample Input Set:

```{r holiday}
Demo_df[11:14,c(1:10)] %>% kableExtra::kable(row.names = FALSE) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

The prediction of different models are shown below:

```{r holidaypredi}
Demo_df[11:14,c(11:16)] %>% kableExtra::kable(col.names = c("Actual Bike Demand","Full Linear Model","Reduced Linear Model","Decision Tree","Grid Search Random Forest","Random Forest"),row.names = FALSE) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

From the above outputs, we conclude that **Random Forest** works best for all kinds of changes in Dataset.
