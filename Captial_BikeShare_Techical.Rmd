## Chapter 1: Introduction

![](Images/CapBi Banner.jpg)

Capital Bikeshare (also called CapBi) is a bicycle sharing system that serves Washington DC, Arlington County, Alexandria, Falls Church, Montgomery County, Prince George's County, and Fairfax County. The Capital Bikeshare system is owned by the local governments and is operated by Motivate International, Inc.(Motivate International, Inc). As of August 2019, Capital Bike has 500 stations and 4300 bicycles.

The distribution of the docks is shown below:
![](Images/Bike Density.png)

As we can see from the above image, the majority of the docks for the bicycle are in Washington DC. 

Bike tours in Washington DC are not only a popular family activity but renting a bike is a great way to get around without breaking the bank or sitting in traffic. There are dedicated bike lanes in Washington DC hence there is safety and convenience for the rider. 

Capital BikeShare is undoubtedly **cheaper** than its competitors and the docks are conveniently placed around monumental locations. Capital Bikeshare is often faster than other modes of transportation and its annual membership offers unlimited trips under 30 minutes which helps save money. CapBi can be used to commute to work or ride to meet friends and is a great alternative for exercise since it is human-powered instead of electric powered. CapBi services save fuel, prevents carbon emissions, it is not only healthy for the rider but also for the environment. 

As CapBi services are very popular and always in demand, we want to predict the number of bikes riders will use per hour and have contingencies to fulfill the demand. To estimate the number of bikes required we will consider various factors such as weather, temperature, working or non-working hour, the hour of the day, etc.

Fun Fact: CapBi offers GWU students annual membership for only 25$.("Capital Bikeshare Discount")

## Chapter 2: Description of Data

### 2.1 Source of data

The data is sourced from the official Capital Bikeshare website, https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We have downloaded data for **September 2013 to September 2019**.

The **official data** contains only the following variables:

Variable | Description
---------|-------------
Duration | Duration of trip
Start Date | Includes start date and time
End Date | Includes end date and time
Start Station | Includes starting station name and number
End Station | Includes ending station name and number
Bike Number | Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
Member Type |Indicates whether user was a "registered" member (Annual Member, 30-Day Member or Day Key Member) or a "casual" rider (Single Trip, 24-Hour Pass, 3-Day Pass or 5-Day Pass)

We dropped irrelevant columns like Duration, End Date, End Station, Bike Number and Member Type from official capital bike share dataset. 

To predict the number of bikes to be used hourly we *scraped the weather data* from following website: https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/va/arlington-county/KDCA/.

To also understand whether *holiday* influences the increase or decrease in bike usage we downloaded the holiday dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/gsnehaa21/federal-holidays-usa-19662020.

```{r}
bike_captial_df <- read.csv("./rawF_CapitalBikeShare.csv")
```

We merged all the different data sources into a single file and the structure for that file is as follows:
```{r}
str(bike_captial_df)
```


### 2.2 Preprocessing of Data

Once the merging of data is done we will preprocess our data. We dropped irrelevant columns like Start.station, Wind, Wind.Gust..mph., Pressure..in., Precip...in. as they are not useful for our analysis. 

```{r}
# Dropping irrelevant columns
bike_captial_df <- subset(bike_captial_df, select = -c(Start.station,Wind,Wind.Gust..mph.,Pressure..in.,Precip...in.))
```

The variable Condition has 47 unique levels:
```{r}
sort(unique(bike_captial_df$Condition))
```

We condense Condition column from 47 levels into 6 levels. 

If condition is Cloudy,Cloudy / Windy,Mostly Cloudy,Mostly Cloudy / Windy,Partly Cloudy,Partly Cloudy / Windy we replace it by Cloudy alone. Similar logic is used of other weather conditions as well.
```{r}
# Condensing "Condition" variable to 6 levels from 47 levels.

# Removing empty string
bike_captial_df <- subset(bike_captial_df, Condition != "")

# converting from factor to character
bike_captial_df$Condition <- as.character(bike_captial_df$Condition)

# condensing for cloudy
bike_captial_df$Condition[bike_captial_df$Condition %in% c("Cloudy","Cloudy / Windy","Mostly Cloudy","Mostly Cloudy / Windy","Partly Cloudy","Partly Cloudy / Windy")] <- "Cloudy"

# condensing for Windy
bike_captial_df$Condition[bike_captial_df$Condition %in% c("Squalls / Windy","Thunder","Thunder / Windy","Thunder in the Vicinity","Wintry Mix","Wintry Mix / Windy")] <- "Windy"

# condensing for Fair
bike_captial_df$Condition[bike_captial_df$Condition %in% c("Fair","Fair / Windy")] <- "Fair"

# condensing for Fog
bike_captial_df$Condition[bike_captial_df$Condition %in% c("Fog","Mist","Patches of Fog","Shallow Fog","Haze")] <- "Fog"

# condensing for Rain
bike_captial_df$Condition[bike_captial_df$Condition %in% c("Heavy Rain","Heavy Rain / Windy","Light Rain","Light Rain / Windy","Light Rain with Thunder","Rain","Rain / Windy","Light Drizzle","Light Drizzle / Windy","Heavy T-Storm","Heavy T-Storm / Windy","T-Storm","T-Storm / Windy")]<-"Rain"

# condensing for Snow
bike_captial_df$Condition[bike_captial_df$Condition %in% c("Heavy Snow","Light Freezing Drizzle","Light Sleet","Light Sleet / Windy","Light Snow","Light Snow / Windy","Light Snow and Sleet","Light Snow and Sleet / Windy","Rain and Sleet","Rain and Snow","Sleet","Snow","Snow and Sleet","Light Freezing Rain")]<-"Snow"
```

We finally have the following levels in Condition column:
```{r}
sort(unique(bike_captial_df$Condition))
```

The Holiday column has the following levels:
```{r}
unique(bike_captial_df$Holiday)
```

We convert the Holiday column from factors into a **binary column** where 0 means no Holiday and 1 means Holiday.

```{r}
# convert Holiday column to binary variable
bike_captial_df <- mutate(bike_captial_df, Holiday = ifelse(is.na(Holiday),0,1))
```

Since our dataset has information about the number of bikes used per hour across various stations, we want to simplify this thus we aggregate all the CapBi data on an hourly basis.

```{r}
# aggregate data on hourly basis and left join with original dataset, then keep only distinct rows and sort by start date
bike_captial <- (bike_captial_df %>% dplyr::group_by(Start.date) %>% dplyr::summarise(Total_Bikes = sum(noOfBikes))) %>% left_join( subset(bike_captial_df, select=-noOfBikes), by = "Start.date") %>% distinct(Start.date,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% arrange(Start.date)
```

We also rename the columns for ease of use. We use the **lubridate** package to extract the hour, month, day and year from the Start_Date column which is of type character. For example 2019-09-20 18:00:00 is the date and thus the hour is 18, month is 09, day is 20 and year is 2019.
```{r}
# renaming the columns
colnames(bike_captial) <- c("Start_Date","Total_Bikes","Condition","Temp","Dew","Humidity","Windspeed","Holiday","Weekday","TimeofDay","Season")

# using lubridate to etract hour, month, day, bike
bike_captial$HourOfDay <- hour(bike_captial$Start_Date)
bike_captial$Month <- month(bike_captial$Start_Date)
bike_captial$Day <- day(bike_captial$Start_Date)
bike_captial$Year <- year(bike_captial$Start_Date)
```

```{r}
# repositioning the Y-variable i.e. the Total_Bikes and placing it at the end 
bike_captial <- bike_captial[c(1,3:15,2)]
```

We convert the following columns to factors HourOfDay, Month, Year, Day, Condition, Holiday, Weekday, TimeofDay, Season and the final processed dataframe looks as follows:
```{r}
# converting all categorical variables to factors
bike_captial$HourOfDay <- as.factor(bike_captial$HourOfDay)
bike_captial$Month <- as.factor(bike_captial$Month)
bike_captial$Year <- as.factor(bike_captial$Year)
bike_captial$Day <- as.factor(bike_captial$Day)
bike_captial$Condition <- as.factor(bike_captial$Condition)
bike_captial$Holiday <- as.factor(bike_captial$Holiday)
bike_captial$Weekday <- as.factor(bike_captial$Weekday)
bike_captial$TimeofDay <- as.factor(bike_captial$TimeofDay)
bike_captial$Season <- as.factor(bike_captial$Season)

str(bike_captial)
```

The first 6 rows of the final processed dataset are:
```{r}
head(bike_captial) %>% kableExtra::kable() %>% kableExtra::kable_styling()
```


## Chapter 4: Exploratory Data Analysis

### 4.1 SMART Question:

#### What is the total number of bikes rented at a given hour based on temperature and season?

```{r}
# dataframe for eda purposes
capbs <- bike_captial

#remove year 2013 and 2019
capbs <- bike_captial[bike_captial$Year != "2013" & bike_captial$Year != "2019",]

# convert hour factor to continuous values
capbs$HourOfDay <- as.integer(as.character(capbs$HourOfDay))
```

### 4.2 Bike Demand by Season and Temperature

From the plots below we can see that winter is the least favorite season for hiring bikes while spring, summer, and fall have pretty similar patterns. 

```{r}
# to have consistent theme for all plots
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

```{r}
ggplot()+ geom_jitter(aes(Season,Total_Bikes,color=Season),alpha =0.5, data=capbs, show.legend = FALSE) + labs(title = "Distribution of Bikes per Season")+xlab("Season")+ylab("Number of Bikes")
```

In this plot we also include the temperature, and observe that higher numbers of bikes are rented in each season when temperatures are between 80-90 degree Fahrenheit.

```{r}
ggplot(capbs, aes(x = Temp,  y = Total_Bikes)) + geom_point(aes(color = Season,alpha =0.1), show.legend = FALSE) + facet_grid(rows =vars(Season)) + geom_smooth() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,2000), breaks=seq(0,2000,500)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,120), breaks=seq(0,120,15)) + xlab("Temperature")+ ylab("Number of bikes") + labs(title = "Distribution of Bikes based on Season and Temperature") 
```


### 4.3 Bike Demand by Weather Conditions

The plot shows that people like to bike most in cloudy weather, followed by fair. Rain, snow, windy etc. are not preferred.

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_jitter(aes(Condition,Total_Bikes,color = Condition),alpha=0.5, data=capbs, show.legend = FALSE) + labs(title = "Distribution of Bike by Weather Condition") + ylab("Number of Bikes") + xlab("Weather Condition")
```


### 4.4 Bike Demand by Year, Weekday & Hour of the Day

There is a steady increase in the number of bikes rented up to the year 2017 and then it decreased in 2018. Also, more bikes are hired during the weekday as compared to weekends.

```{r}
# aggregating based on weekday and year
bikeShareWeekDay <- capbs %>%
        dplyr::group_by(Year, Weekday) %>%
        dplyr::summarise(Total_Bikes = sum(Total_Bikes, na.rm = TRUE))

# 52 * 5 = 260 Weekdays, divide to normalize values
bikeShareWeekDay[bikeShareWeekDay$Weekday == "Weekday","Total_Bikes"] <- round(bikeShareWeekDay[bikeShareWeekDay$Weekday == "Weekday","Total_Bikes"]/260)

# 52 * 2 = 104 Weekends, divide to normalize values
bikeShareWeekDay[bikeShareWeekDay$Weekday == "Weekend","Total_Bikes"] <- round(bikeShareWeekDay[bikeShareWeekDay$Weekday == "Weekend","Total_Bikes"]/104)
  
ggplot(bikeShareWeekDay, aes(factor(Year), Total_Bikes, fill = factor(Weekday))) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + labs(title = "Bikes rented by Year/Weekday",fill = "Day of Week") + scale_y_continuous(labels= comma) + xlab("Year") + ylab("Number of Bikes")
```

The bikes hired peak during morning and evening 8 AM and 6 PM rush hours when people are heading or returning back from work.

```{r}
ggplot(capbs, aes(x=HourOfDay, y=Total_Bikes, color = HourOfDay)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend = FALSE) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,24,2)) + labs(title = "Distribution of Bikes per hour") + xlab("Hour of Day") + ylab("Number of bikes")
```

### 4.5 Bike Demand by Holiday

We notice that riders rent bike more often on days when there is no holiday, but the number of bikes rented during holidays is still significant.

```{r}
holidayBike <- capbs %>% group_by(Holiday) %>% dplyr::summarise("Total Bikes" = sum(Total_Bikes), "Count of Holiday" = n())

# normalize the bike demand, by dividing by Count of Holiday and non holidays
holidayBike$NormalizedCount <- holidayBike$`Total Bikes`/holidayBike$`Count of Holiday`
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = holidayBike) + ggplot2::geom_bar(aes(x=Holiday,y=NormalizedCount,fill = c("green","red")),stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) + labs(title = "Normalized Bike Distribution for Holiday") + xlab("Holiday?") + ylab("Number of Bikes") + scale_x_discrete(labels=c("No","Yes"))
```


### 4.6 Correlation Between Bikes Hired and Weather 

There is a positive 44% correlation between temperature and bikes hired, additionally, Humidity has a negative correlation of 30%. 

The correlation table is as follows:
```{r}
newdata <- capbs[c(15,3:6,11)]
newdata1 = round(cor(newdata),2) 
newdata1 %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

The correlation plot is as follows:
```{r}
cex.before <- par("cex")
par(cex = 0.7)
corrplot(newdata1,tl.col="black",addCoef.col="black",tl.cex = 1/par("cex"),cl.cex = 1/par("cex"), addCoefasPercent =TRUE,col=colorRampPalette(c("#9370DB","#E6E6FA","#9400D3"))(10))
```

## Chapter 5: Model Assessment

### 5.1 Splitting into Train and Test Data

For our analysis we *scale all the numeric variables* like Temperature, Dew, Humidity and WindSpeed to avoid skewed results.

```{r}
# scaling only the numeric columns like Temp,Dew, Humidity, Windspeed
bike_captial[c("Temp","Dew","Humidity","Windspeed")] <- lapply(bike_captial[c("Temp","Dew","Humidity","Windspeed")], function(x) c(scale(x)))
```

We now split our dataset into Train and Test splits. For the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 we are considering these samples for **training** our model and using the sample for the year 2019 we will validate the performance of the model.

```{r}
Training_Set <- subset(bike_captial, Year %in% c(2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018))
Test_Set <- subset(bike_captial, Year %in% c(2019))
```

In our training set we have total **`r nrow(Training_Set)`** samples and for testing our model we have total **`r nrow(Test_Set)`** samples. 

We also drop irrelevant columns like Start_Date, Month, Day and Year in our training and test set, as these are not useful when creating models.
```{r}
# drop irrelevant columns in Training Set
Training_Set <- subset(Training_Set, select = -c(Start_Date,Month,Day,Year))
```

```{r}
# rename the outcome variable as y
names(Training_Set)[11] <- "y"
```

```{r}
# drop irrelevant columns in Test Set
Test_Set <- subset(Test_Set, select = -c(Start_Date,Month,Day,Year))
```

As we need to predict the number of bikes which is a **numerical value, we have to perform regression** analysis. We will create models using Linear Regression and then try to optimize it. We will use Decision Tree for regression and also try Bagged Decision Trees. Finally we will create a random forest model and try to tune it to get best results.


### 5.2 Linear Regression Model

We perform linear regression, using training data set and all the variables we predict the number of bikes per hour which is our 'y' variable.

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(y~.,data = Training_Set)
```

The summary of linear model is as follows:
```{r}
sumLm <- summary(fit1)
sumLm
```

We notice that the R-squared value for linear model with all the variables is **`r sumLm$r.squared`**.

We want to know how much of each variable contributes to the Linear model R-squared value i.e we want to know the relative importance of each variable in Linear model. For this we make use of the **relaimpo** package, and use the function calc.relimp.
```{r}
relativeImpFullLM <- calc.relimp(fit1, type = c("lmg"), rela = TRUE)
```

```{r}
relativeImpFullLM$lmg %>% kable(col.names = c("LMG")) %>% kable_styling()
```

#### 5.2.1 Feature selection on Linear Regression model

We have already evaluated the performance of linear model using all predictor variables, we now perform feature selection so that we can create a linear model with a subset of the variables without compromising on the accuracy. 

The output for forward feature selection is as follows:
```{r}
lmbest.fwd = regsubsets(y~.,data = Training_Set,nvmax = 10, nbest =1,method = "forward")
plot(lmbest.fwd,scale="adjr2",main="Adjusted R^2")
plot(lmbest.fwd,scale="bic",main="BIC")
plot(lmbest.fwd,scale="Cp",main="Cp")
```

We observe that variables like Temp, TimeofDayWorkingHour, HourOfDay8, and HourOfDay18 are important.

The output for backward feature selection is as follows:
```{r}
lmbest.bwd = regsubsets(y~.,data = Training_Set,nvmax = 10, nbest =1,method = "backward")
plot(lmbest.bwd,scale="adjr2",main="Adjusted R^2")
plot(lmbest.bwd,scale="bic",main="BIC")
plot(lmbest.bwd,scale="Cp",main="Cp")
```

Similarly we observe that variables like Temp, Humidity, HourOfDay8, HourOfDay12, HourOfDay13 and  HourOfDay18 are important.

### 5.3 Optimize the Multiple Linear Regression Model

First, we run the model with four selected variables Temp, Dew, TimeofDay, HourOfDay based on feature selection done in section 5.2.1. 

```{r reducedmodel-1}
#feature selection
reducedmodel_4 <- lm(y ~ Temp + Dew + TimeofDay + HourOfDay, data = Training_Set)

#display the summary of the reduced model 
summaryreducedmodel_4 <- summary(reducedmodel_4) 
summaryreducedmodel_4
``` 

Then, we remove the *Timeofday* as it has a high p-value and thus is not significant, and rerun the model with three remaining variables. 

The summary of linear model, using Temp, Dew, HourOfDay as predictors is as follows:
```{r}
#exclude the timeofday since it has a high p value
reducedmodel_3 <- lm(y ~ Temp + Dew + HourOfDay, data = Training_Set)

#display the summary of the reduced model 
summaryreducedmodel_3 <- summary(reducedmodel_3) 
summaryreducedmodel_3
``` 

Based on the rules of each criterion, the variables having the largest adjusted R^2^, R^2^, and Cp value, or lowest BIC value would be considered. However, in our case, all four criteria reached the same four variables, which are temperature, dew point, time of the day, and hour of the day. So we built a new model with these four variables. 

Furthermore, we find out that the model can be condensed into three variables by removing 'TimeOfDay' and keeping only Temp, Dew and HourOfDay. 

As the results displayed below, the reduced model includes only 3 variables but can still achieve R^2^ as high as the full model. Therefore, we choose the reduced model over the full model and move on to the next phase of the optimization process.

Type of Model|Model Formula | R-squared | Adjusted R-squared
------|-------------|------------|-----------------
Reduced Model |y ~ Temp + Dew  + HourOfDay | `r summaryreducedmodel_3$r.squared` | `r summaryreducedmodel_3$adj.r.squared`
Full Model | y ~ . | `r sumLm$r.squared` | `r sumLm$adj.r.squared`

Temperature and Dew point have high VIF value, which also indicates that two of them are correlated and there is a possibility of multicollinearity. 

```{r vif, echo = FALSE, include= TRUE}
#multicollinearity
vif(reducedmodel_3)[,"GVIF"] %>% kable(col.names = "GVIF") %>% kable_styling()
``` 

Thus we create 2 more linear models, the first one includes Temp but excludes dew and summary for that model is as follows:
```{r}
#exclude the dew since it has high vif 
reducedmodel_2 <- lm(y ~ Temp + HourOfDay, data = Training_Set)
#display the summary of the reduced model 
summaryreducedmodel_2 <- summary(reducedmodel_2) 
summaryreducedmodel_2
```

The second linear model excludes temp, but includes Dew and summary for that model is as follows:
```{r}
#exclude the temp since it has high vif 
reducedmodel_1 <- lm(y ~ Dew + HourOfDay, data = Training_Set)
summaryreducedmodel_1 <- summary(reducedmodel_1) 
#display the summary of the reduced model 
summaryreducedmodel_1
``` 

The model with temperature i.e. the first linear model has higher R^2^ value, thus the *final linear model* consists of Temperature and Hour of Day. Hence using 2 variables we can explain **`r round(summaryreducedmodel_2$r.squared *100,2)`%** of variation in our training dataset.

#### 5.3.1 Relative importance

We want to know the relative importance of each variable for our final linear model, which consists of only 2 variables, Temp and HourOfDay.
Using **relaimpo** package, we can conclude from the final linear model that the hour of the day variable provides high contribution for predicting the bike usage. 

```{r ri, echo = FALSE, include= TRUE}
#find out the feature contributed the most 
bike <- calc.relimp(reducedmodel_2, type = c("lmg"), rela = TRUE)
``` 

```{r}
bike$lmg %>% kable(col.names = "LMG") %>% kable_styling()
```

The plot of the relative importance is shown below:
```{r}
#plot the result
barplot(bike$lmg, main = "Contribution Percentages", xlab = "Variables", ylab = "Relative Importance", col = c("palegreen", "royalblue1"))
```


### 5.4 Decision Tree

After performing Regression using linear model, we now perform regression using Decision Trees. Decision Trees have the advantage that they are simple to create and can work with non-linear data.

To save computational time we have stored the Decision Tree model as RDS file, and read the RDS file for our predictions.
```{r}
# save decision tree as rds model 

# set.seed(100)
# decisionTree <- caret::train(y~., data=Training_Set, method="rpart2", tuneLength = 9, trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",number = 10, repeats = 3))
# saveRDS(decisionTree,"Saved Models/tunedDecisionTree.rds")

#read the saved RDS file
decisionTree <- readRDS("Saved Models/tunedDecisionTree.rds")
```

We have created a decision tree using **Caret** package. The "rpart2" method of caret's train model creates a decision tree by tuning based on the depth of the decision tree. We have specified the max depth to be 10, by using the argument **tuneLength=9**. We have also performed 10-Fold cross validation and repeated this 3 times.

The decision tree is as follows:
```{r}
decisionTree
```

As we see from above summary the final depth used for creating decision tree is 10, and the plot for RMSE values with respect to max depth of decision tree is as follows:

```{r}
plot(decisionTree,main = "Tuning Regression Decision Tree based on Max Tree Depth")
```

As the depth of tree increases the performance increases i.e. the RMSE value of model decreases.

The Decision Tree which we will use for prediction is as follows::
```{r}
rpart.plot(decisionTree$finalModel, type = 5, box.palette = "Or", shadow.col = "gray", main = "Regression Decision Tree for predicting the number of bikes")
```

The importance of the variables for decision tree is shown below:
```{r}
gbmImp <- caret::varImp(decisionTree)
plot(gbmImp,top = 20)
```

We notice that the variables Temp, WeekdayWeekend, Dew, SeasonWinter and HourOfDay18 have high variable importance. The importance of variable depends on how high it shows up in the decision tree and also depends on number of times that variable repeats.(Therneau, 2019, p. 11)

We have trained our Decision Tree for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 dataset. We now perform predictions based on 2019 dataset.

```{r}
dtTunedPredictions <- predict(decisionTree,Test_Set)
```

The evaluation metrics of Decision Tree is as follows:

```{r}
data.frame(
  R2 = caret::R2(dtTunedPredictions,Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  RMSE = caret::RMSE(dtTunedPredictions,Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  MAE = caret::MAE(dtTunedPredictions,Test_Set$Total_Bikes)
) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

#### 5.4.1 Bagged Decision Tree

Decision Tree have a drawback, they are not flexible and perform poorly with a new sample of data. Thus we use Bagging which is a combination of Bootstrapping the Data and performing Aggregation.

Bagged Decision Trees creates an ensemble of decision trees. Bagged Decision Trees overcome the drawback of Decision Trees by estimating the value based on majority or averages.

To save computational time we have stored the Bagged Decision Tree model as RDS file, and read the RDS file for our predictions.

```{r}
# baggedTree <- caret::train(y~.,Training_Set,method="treebag",trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", repeats = 3, number = 10))
# saveRDS(baggedTree,"Saved Models/baggedTree.rds")
baggedTree <- readRDS("Saved Models/baggedTree.rds")
```

We have created a bagged decision tree using **Caret** package. The "treebag" method of caret's train model creates a bagged decision tree. For bagged Decision tree there is no tuning parameter. We have performed 10-Fold cross validation and repeated this 3 times.

The bagged decision tree is as follows:

```{r}
baggedTree
```

The importance of the variables for decision tree is shown below:

```{r}
baggedTreeImp <- varImp(baggedTree)
plot(baggedTreeImp,top = 20)
```

We notice that the variables Temp, WeekdayWeekend, Dew, HourOfDay18 and SeasonWinter have high variable importance.

We have trained our Decision Tree for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 dataset. We now perform predictions based on 2019 dataset.

```{r}
baggedDtTunedPredictions <- predict(baggedTree,Test_Set)
```

The evaluation metrics of Decision Tree is as follows:

```{r}
data.frame(
  R2 = R2(baggedDtTunedPredictions,Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  RMSE = RMSE(baggedDtTunedPredictions,Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  MAE = MAE(baggedDtTunedPredictions,Test_Set$Total_Bikes)
) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

Thus using bagged decision tree we got slightly higher r-squared values in comparison to decision trees.

### 5.6 Random Forest

Finally, we model using Random Forest. 

In bagged tree model, different samples of dataset is taken and model is trained to get best possible value. As all variables are used to train the model, there are chances we may overfit the model with full variables and there might be a chance most significant variable of the dataset can also be depressed by other variables in the dataset. 

Lets try with limited number of variable and check its performance. we have 10 variables with us, do we need to try all different options? lets use information that we gained from previous models like linear regression, decision tree. More than 80% of the variable importance are obtained by top three variables. So lets start out hunt three variable model. 

There are two predominant variable that finds to be important in previous model, but third variable is hard to choose. lets try all different combination of three variable to check the model performance.

We have used random forest package to train model, which takes mtry(number of variables to be used to train each samples) as n/3 by default for regression model. 

To save computational time, we have trained the model and loaded the file to check its performance.

```{r}
# fit <- randomForest(y ~ .,   data=Training_Set)
# saveRDS(fit,"Saved Models/RandomForest_train.rds")
rf_fit <- readRDS("Saved Models/RandomForest_train.rds")
```

Lets use our model to predict the test model. 

```{r}
pred <- predict(rf_fit,Test_Set[1:10])
```

The evaluation metrics of Random Forest is as follows:

```{r}
data.frame(
  R2 = R2(pred, Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  RMSE = RMSE(pred, Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  MAE = MAE(pred, Test_Set$Total_Bikes)
) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

This model gave us best R2 value so far. lets check importance of each variable to identify top three variable.

```{r}
importance(rf_fit)
```

Mean Decrease Accuracy(%IncMSE) and Mean Decrease Gini(IncNodePurity) are calculated on the trained model. 

Mean Decrease Accuracy(%IncMSE) - Refers to how much model accuracy decreases if we leave out that variable.

Mean Decrease Gini(IncNodePurity) - is the measure of variable importance based on the Gini impurity index used for calculating the splits in trees.

We could see HourOfDay, Weekday, Holiday, Condition, Temp are the most important variables similar to the other model's relative importance. 

Hang on! let's try different combinations of variables from 1 to 5 with cross-validation(5 fold cross-validation) and also we repeat the same process for 3 three different samples to get averaged best output.

#### 5.6.1 Tuning/Optimizing Random Forest:

We tune/optimize Random Forest by using grid search and setting mtry in the range of 1 to 5.

To train the model takes quite some time, thus we have already trained the model, stored it and read directly from disk for faster execution and knitting of file.

```{r}
#control <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv", number=5, repeats=3, search="grid",verboseIter = TRUE)
#set.seed(seed)
#tunegrid <- expand.grid(.mtry=c(1:5))
#rf_gridsearch <- train(y~., data=Training_Set, method="rf", tuneGrid=tunegrid, trControl=control, iimportance = TRUE)
##saveRDS(fit,"Saved Models/RandomForest_train_gridsearch.rds")
rf_gridsearch <- readRDS("Saved Models/RandomForest_train_gridsearch.rds")
```

Different variable models from 1 to 5 combinations, were tried and we could see R2 value increases as the number of variables increases. 

```{r}
print(rf_gridsearch)
```


The plot describes that the Mean Square error decreases when the number of predictors increases(not surprising). 

```{r}
plot(rf_gridsearch)
```


Let's use this model, which used various combinations to get accurate prediction with less number of variables to predict the test data.

```{r}
pred_grid <- predict(rf_gridsearch,Test_Set[1:10])
```

```{r}
data.frame(
  R2 = R2(pred_grid, Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  RMSE = RMSE(pred_grid, Test_Set$Total_Bikes),
  MAE = MAE(pred_grid, Test_Set$Total_Bikes)
) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

With the maximum of 5 variable model combination, we could able to achieve a R2 of upto **0.88**. Lets check which variables constitute more to this R2 value. 

```{r}
plot(varImp(object = rf_gridsearch), top = 20)
```

As most of the variables are categorical values, each level is treated as levels and we could see HourofDay and weekday, condition, Temp are the variables that contribute much to our model. 

Hourofday - 18 is the best predictor, weekend or not, time of day with working day makes good observation points in determining the total number of bikes consumed by users for a given hour. 

### 5.8 Model Comparison

Model | No. of Predictor | R2 [Test Data] | Variable Importance(desc)
------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------------
Linear Regression| Full Model i.e. all variables | 0.69 | HourOfDay, Temp, TimeOfDay
Linear Regression| 2 |0.67| HourOfDay,Temp
Decision Tree| Full Model i.e. all variables | 0.73 | Temp, Weekday, Dew, Season, HourOfDay
Bagged Tree | Full Model i.e. all variables |0.74 | Temp, Weekday, Dew, HourOfDay, Season
Random Forest | 3 |0.93 | HourOfDay, Weekday, Holiday, Condition, Temp
Random Forest- Grid Search| Combination of 1 to 5 variables | 0.88 | HourOfDay, Weekday, Holiday, Temp, Holiday

Thus random forest performs the best with the R-square value being highest at 0.93.

## Chapter 6: Conclusion

In terms of modelling & predictions, we can conclude that :

* Random Forest works best with the given dataset

* Maximum R2 value obtained is 0.93

* Variable Importance are as follows:
  + Hour of Day – Best 6PM-7PM,8-9AM
  
  + Weekday – Weekend
  
  + Time of Day – Working Hour
  
  + Temp – Moderate Temperature – 70–90F 

The insights which we got from our analysis is that on a normal day, users tend to ride a bike for commuting to offices, schools, etc. But on weekends & holidays, people prefer to use bikes for travel and leisure activity purposes. We also derive that bikes are preferred maximum in moderate temperatures and users tend to avoid bikes at high temperatures and low temperatures.
 
Based on our analysis we recommend that during high demand in morning and evening office hours and weekend/holiday, Capital Bikeshare should increase availability during these hours. Thus catering to more users and in turn, securing more profits.
